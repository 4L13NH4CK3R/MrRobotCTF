# Mr. Robot CTF  
*Who knew the hit TV Show "Mr. Robot" would get so much flare?!?!*  
When I first started to watch this show, I was completely amazed at how much detail went into the hacking aspect of the show. They literally showed us how to hack anything & everything.  
Getting Access to a secured building ~ Social Engineering!  
Intercepting Phone Calls & Text Messages ~ IMSI Catcher!  
Bruteforcing ~ Well... We know what that is already! LOL  
  
## Download & Setup Mr. Robot  
**Download VirtualBox** ~ The first thing we will need for this challenge is VirtualBox. *It is free, don't worry!*

**Download Kali Linux** ~ The *Hackers* Operating System of Choice! *Parrot OS Works Just As Well Too!*

***Mr. Robot VM*** ~ The target we are trying to Hack Into! (https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/)  
**Setup Mr. Robot & Kali** ~ While we can just install the Kali on our Virtual Box, and double click on Wakanda to import. We do need to do 1 more thing!  
***Setup NAT Network*** ~ This is rather simple, follow these tasks;  
*Inside of VirtualBox;*  
1) Open Tools -> Networking -> (Select NAT Networks Tab)  
2) Click "Create"  
3) Inside of Name ~ Anything you want. I used (HackingNetwork)  
4) Inside of IPv4 Prefix ~ 10.0.0.0/24
